# Busdriver The Cardgame

Busdriver is a party game that is played with a normal deck of cards. We felt the need to be able to play this game without physical cards. Mostly due to concerns of space, ruining cards with spilt drinks, or just forgetting the deck and being unable to play because of it. But everyone is used to carrying a phone, and so, we decided to digitalize it. This project has been made at Tallinn University for the Software Development Project.
